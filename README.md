This project handles the fourth step in buttom-up SLR() parsing, which is constructing the stack implemenation where the table handles arbitrary cases of input from the user using the parsing table and the production rules as an input too to handle the users's arbitrary input cases. stack implemenation table check if the input is valid and corresponding to the production rules provided. Then, it manipulates the input by checking the parsing table and production rules in action colmns in shift and reduce steps to eventually eneding up with accepted input or not.
